* make real shell script with functions for install, start, stop, reload, etc.
    maybe make this part of "npm start, build, stop, etc."
* use browserify so we can run this thing as a web page (with auto compile and reload, too)
* load configuration documents
* pass in arguments to atom-shell from command line (like dev vs. deploy)
